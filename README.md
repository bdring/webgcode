Webgcode
========
This has been forked from [nraynaud](https://github.com/nraynaud/webgcode). The goal is to evaluate it for use as a gcode viewer web app on the ESP32 server in [Grbl_ESP32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32) 

### Changes

The app will be reduced to just a GCode viewer (read only) and a 3D gcode viewer.  The 2D window will be removed to improve speed and give more room for the 3D viewer.

There will some way to read the files off the SD card of the ESP_32.
